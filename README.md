LongitudinalChange
==================
Diffusion values such as FA, MD, AD(pararell), and RD(parpendicular)are relative values. Probably We can't compare the values in longitudinally. But several publication, in fact,  already do this kind od comparison.

We don't know if it is worthy. 

So let's take a look our data.
 1) Normal subject
 2) retinal disease patients
 3) old healthy subject
 
 and so on.
